**Project score : [124 / 100]**

Lem-in is an algorithmic project that rely upon graph theory to find the shortest paths from a point A to a point B. Each route has a maximum capacity, so we used the Edmund-Karp algorithm to improve our results.

## About lem-in

At the beginning from standart output the program recieves information about number of ants had to be leaded through path, room names (can be numbers, words, characters etc.) with coordinates and links. Here is an example:
